# DjikstrasSSSP
Implements the Weighted Directed Graph data structure, and performs Djikstra's shortest path algorithm 
to find the shortest path between two Vertices.

This application requires the use of JavaFX. Although recent versions of the Java SDK don't include it, the library can be added and 
work fine with this application.

Another mention: This was made during a time frame for a project for school. Of course things could have been done better, however 
I wish to leave this the same way it was submitted so I may look back and learn from what I previously made.
